                    <li>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose of sharing status with a consenting

                    <li>To transmit any viruses or malicious code.</li>

                    for
                    any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>In no event shall Couple Status, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or
